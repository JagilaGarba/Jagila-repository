This data was gotten from Kaggle. The data consists of over 4,000 rows and 8 columns. The data describes various countries food price inflation index also providing the open, close, high and low index of each month from 2007 to 2023. The data was filtered to meet the goal of the project.

The goal of this project was to forecast the Nigerian food price index for the next 12 months. This project started by performing data preparation which involved filtering the data to get only Nigeria food price index, dropping attributes that were not required,then exploratory data analysis, this helped the selection of time series models for forecasting. This project involved using libraries such as Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, SkLearn, Statsmodels. Prior to Model building, trend, seasonality and stationarity was analysed by decomposing the inflation index attribute,plotting partial and autocorrelation graphs also performing stationarity tests. 
This project was able to compare various variation of ARIMA models,Naïve method, Simple moving averages and Exponential smoothing. At the end of this project, the naïve method provided the base data point for the forecast and 12 moving averages provided the best forecast to fit the test data split. Therefore the 12 moving average model was implemented to forecast for the next 12 months.
